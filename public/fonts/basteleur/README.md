# Basteleur

This typeface was designed with the Tarot de Marseille in mind. 
This led to a funny blend of medieval-ish and cooperblack-ish typeface. 

The Basteleur Arcana represents a lot of things a designer can experience: new beginnings, having fun, crafting, but also a lack of confidence and having hard time to finish projects.

Basteleur is a typeface by [Keussel](http://www.keussel.studio).
